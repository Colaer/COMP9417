Skim: there are 1 basic implementation(called ?_basic.py) and 3 extra feature(the rest 5 files) in our project.

instructions for this project:
1. knn_classification_basic.py & knn_prediction_basic.py are basic implementation of this project.
2. knn_classification_weighted.py & knn_prediction_weighted.py are extra feature implementation for distance-weighted knn(WNN).
3. knn_prediction_exfeatures_basic.py & knn_prediction_exfeatures_weighted.py are extra feature we come up with.
   according to our face to face interview to our lecturer, Michael Bain, this will influence the balance mark
    and extra feature in part1: code implementation, please take this into consideration.
    Appreciate.
4. plot_all is the extra feature for visualization.

We demonstrate that all of our works are done by our team members, and there is no violation towards the implementation core algorithm.

Yours sincerely,

AI Beginners Team(Benny, Darren, Wallace).
